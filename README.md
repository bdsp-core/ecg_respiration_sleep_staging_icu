# Sleep in the Intensive Care Unit through the Lens of Breathing and Heart Rate Variability

This repository contains code and data used in the research paper "Sleep in the Intensive Care Unit through the Lens of Breathing and Heart Rate Variability: A Cross-Sectional Study".

In /sleep_staging_models/ you can find the ECG HRV and respiratory effort (breathing) based sleep staging models. Architecture and input requirements of these models was presented in:

```
Raw results (spreadsheet containing all results for all sensitivity analyses) for both cohorts are contained in ```results_icu_deidentified.csv``` and ```results_sleeplab_deidentified.csv```.

We will make code to reproduce the figures available once the article has been accepted for publication by a journal.
